Hey Bryce, I have something for you to look into...
* Sure, what is it Coleridge? 1
* Ugh, can't it wait for later? 2
* Let me guess, you need me to see if they are still looking for players in the bingo hall downtown. 3
* Yeah, and I need you to look into leaving me the hell alone! -1

My back hurts really really bad; I'm afraid I won't make it much further...
* Do you need me to fetch you some pain killers? 3
* (Sarcastic) Oh, do you need me to fetch you some pain killers? 3
* Get over it old man, you're lucky I don't give you something else to worry about! 5
* I don't like where this is going... I think I'm gonna go... -1

* Alright, what is it? 1
* Coleridge, buddy, I'd really like to help out and all but... I've actually got shit to do today. 3

Dammit Bryce, you've gone too far with the smartass jokes this time!
* Cool it old man, I was only joking, now what was it you needed? 4
* And you've gone too far with the complaining, lighten up old fella, you're not gonna die any faster being mad at me like this. 5
* Well, fuck you too old man! -1

Oh no, I'm not letting this slide so easily! I am not talking to you for the rest of the day!
* Whatever! -1
* (Under Breath) And to think, it was this easy to get him to shut up this whole time! -1
* No, I'm not talking to YOU for the rest of the day! -1
* So, I have to expect even MORE complaining from you tomorrow? -1
* I have Pizza Rolls! Your favorite! 5
